# NudgeX: A Smart Nudge Factory

We envision a platform to empower users through their journeys on these platforms. NudgeX is an intelligent AI-driven nudging system designed to enhance user engagement and experience on digital platforms. It strategically deploys personalized digital nudges based on user interaction patterns and behavioral data. The system was developed with a focus on three main user journeys: Onboarding, Engagement, and Feedback. NudgeX incorporates advanced Machine Learning algorithms for user classification and nudge generation coupled with the LIME framework for explainability, thereby fostering trust and transparency. This represents a significant step towards more personalized, effective, and user-centric digital platforms.

Our objective is to guide users effectively through nudges, which are subtle context-specific prompts designed to influence user behavior without restricting user choice. Nudges will be personalized and timely, targeting the user at the right time with the most relevant prompt, thereby fostering better engagement and interaction with the platform.

The system combines rule-based logic and machine-learning methods (as more data become available) to determine the most appropriate nudge. The nudges cater to multiple user scenarios, such as new users and idle users. The performance of this nudge system was measured by evaluating the increase in user engagement and asset usage post-implementation of the nudges.

## Benefits of the Platform

- **User Onboarding and Retention**: Implement nudges designed to help new users navigate the platform (onboarding nudges) and re-engage users who have been inactive for a certain period (re-engagement nudges). 

- **Personalization**: Develop a system that can understand and track user behavior on the platform and use this data to create personalized experience. Personalization is at the core of our nudge system as it allows us to provide context-specific nudges to each user.

- **Engagement Improvement**: The primary aim of this system is to improve user engagement within the repositories. The success of this objective can be measured through metrics such as the number of active users, number of return visits, time spent on the platform, and interaction rate with nudges.

- **Feedback Collection**: Encourage users to provide feedback on the assets they interact with. This will help improve the quality of assets and overall user satisfaction.

- **Evaluating and Optimizing Nudge Performance**: Implement a system for measuring the performance of different nudges and use this data to improve the nudge strategy over time.

- **Scalability and Extendibility**: The framework should be built in such a way that new types of nudges can be easily added to the system, allowing for future growth and adaptability.

- **Combining Rule-based and Machine Learning methods**: The system should initially leverage rule-based logic (equivalent to decision trees) to handle the cold start problem and gradually introduce machine learning methods as more data become available.
